# Kitty Claws ‚Äî SEM Images of Cat Claws | UPenn Nanotech üêæüî¨

[![Releases](https://img.shields.io/badge/Releases-Download-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/DiegoX12/kitty-claws/releases)

Microscopic images of Kitty's claws captured with a Quanta 600 FEG Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM). Images come from the Nanoscale Characterization Facility at the Krishna P. Singh Center for Nanotechnology, University of Pennsylvania. The set shows surface detail, wear patterns, and micro-structure at scales from micrometers down to nanometers.

Images show the claw tip, cross-sections, debris, and coating contrasts typical of ESEM secondary electron imaging.

Each image in this repository includes a high-resolution TIFF, a web-ready PNG, and basic metadata (magnification, detector, accelerating voltage, scale bar). See the "File list and structure" section for details.

About the data
- Subject: Kitty (domestic cat) claws.
- Instrument: Quanta 600 FEG ESEM.
- Facility: Nanoscale Characterization Facility, Krishna P. Singh Center for Nanotechnology, University of Pennsylvania.
- Purpose: Document micro-scale wear and morphology of claws for outreach and reference.
- Format: TIFF (lossless), PNG (preview), JSON metadata for each image.
- Typical resolution: 2048√ó2048 to 8000√ó8000 pixels for TIFF. PNG previews at 1200√ó1200 px.

How the images were made
- Sample prep: Cleaned with isopropyl alcohol. Dried in air. Mounted on aluminum stubs with carbon tape.
- Coating: Conductive coating applied where required (carbon or thin gold/palladium).
- ESEM settings:
  - Instrument: Quanta 600 FEG.
  - Mode: Low-vacuum ESEM or high-vacuum SEM depending on sample readiness.
  - Detector: Secondary electron (SE) for topography; backscattered electron (BSE) for composition contrast.
  - Accelerating voltage: 5‚Äì20 kV depending on magnification and coating.
  - Spot size: Adjusted to balance resolution and beam-sample interaction.
- Imaging strategy: Start at low magnification, locate regions of interest, and acquire a set of images at increasing magnification. Acquire scale bars and capture instrument settings in metadata.

Quick start ‚Äî view images locally
- Download the repository or fetch a release asset from:
  https://github.com/DiegoX12/kitty-claws/releases
- If you use the Releases page, download the release file (for example: kitty-claws-v1.0.zip). Run the included viewer script in the archive to open the preview set. For example:
  - On macOS / Linux: unzip the archive and run ./view-claws.sh
  - On Windows: unzip the archive and run view-claws.bat or open the viewer.exe
- The release asset includes:
  - a preview gallery (PNG),
  - a small offline viewer,
  - README and metadata files.
- The Releases page hosts signed artifacts and the most stable image bundles.

Releases
[![Download Releases](https://img.shields.io/badge/Get%20Releases-Download%20Bundle-green?logo=github)](https://github.com/DiegoX12/kitty-claws/releases)

Visit the Releases page to find packaged image sets. Each release includes:
- A zip or tarball with high-resolution TIFFs.
- A preview gallery in PNG.
- An index.json file with metadata.
- A small, cross-platform viewer script to open the previews.

Usage and viewing
- Web: Use the PNG previews for quick browsing. They work in any browser.
- Local: Use ImageJ / Fiji to open TIFFs and inspect metadata and scale bars.
- CLI tools: Use libtiff or exiftool to inspect and process TIFFs.
- Viewer script: The release viewer will open the preview gallery and point to the high-resolution files. Run the viewer from the release archive after download.
- Processing tips:
  - Use non-destructive edits. Work on copies.
  - Preserve the original TIFFs for any quantitative work.
  - For publication, export PNG or JPEG at 300 dpi with an embedded scale bar.
